This is a little experiment to learn how to use pygame with pytorch . 

I used this Tutorial : 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8ypSXwyBds 

Original Code: 
https://github.com/patrickloeber/snake-ai-pytorch/tree/main

The tutorial also showed that we need to also fix : 
- snake is in an endless loop.
- snake traps itself and dies :(

Thank for reading and have a wonderful  rest of the week :) 

after installing the pygame enviroment as the video suggested:
in conda : 
```bash
conda activate pygame_env
```
and in the project folder : 
```bash
(pygame_env) $ python agent.py
```
